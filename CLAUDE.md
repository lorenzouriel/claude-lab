# master-claude

A unified Claude Code workspace combining software engineering workflow (AgentSpec) with content squad orchestration (Opensquad). One tool, one mental model.

---

## Quick Start

### Software Engineering (AgentSpec)

| Command | Phase | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `/workflow:brainstorm` | 0 | Explore ideas through dialogue |
| `/workflow:define` | 1 | Capture and validate requirements |
| `/workflow:design` | 2 | Create architecture and technical spec |
| `/workflow:build` | 3 | Execute implementation |
| `/workflow:ship` | 4 | Archive completed feature |

### Content Squads (Opensquad)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/squad` | Open the main squad menu |
| `/squad create` | Create a new content squad (conversational) |
| `/squad run <name>` | Execute a squad's pipeline |
| `/squad edit <name>` | Modify an existing squad |
| `/squad skills` | Browse and install squad skills |
| `/squad:dashboard-design` | Design the 2D virtual office |

### Other Commands

- `/review` — Code review
- `/visual-explainer:*` — Visual diagrams and explainers
- `/data-engineering:*` — Data pipeline tools
- `/core:memory` — Save session insights

## How the Two Systems Work Together

Both systems share the same phased workflow pattern:

```
AgentSpec:  Brainstorm → Define → Design → Build → Ship   (software)
Opensquad:  Discovery  → Investigate → Design → Build → Run (content)
```

They are independent but complementary:
- Use **AgentSpec** when building software, data pipelines, or technical features
- Use **Opensquad** when creating content, running marketing automation, or orchestrating multi-agent creative workflows
- master-claude's **Claude Code agents** (`.claude/agents/`) can be referenced as available team members when creating squads

---

## Company Profile (Opensquad)

On first `/squad` run, you'll be prompted to set up your company profile. This is saved to `_squad/_memory/company.md` and loaded for every squad run.

To update: `/squad edit-company`
To view: `/squad show-company`

---

## Squad Dashboard

The live visualization runs as a separate local server:

```bash
cd dashboard && npm run dev
```

Then use `/squad:dashboard-design` to customize the 2D office.

## Rules

- Use `/workflow:*` for software engineering work
- Use `/squad` for content creation and automation
- Never manually edit files in `_squad/core/`
- Company context (`_squad/_memory/`) is gitignored — it's private to you
- Squad outputs (`squads/*/output/`) are gitignored — generated content stays local
