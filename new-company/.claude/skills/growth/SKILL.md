## Boundaries — when NOT to use this hub

- **Cold outreach to new prospects** → `business/cold-email` (this hub's `email-marketing` is for opted-in lifecycle/drip/nurture only)
- **Weekly cross-platform content plan** → `content/content-planner` (this hub's `content-marketing` is quarter-level strategy: pillars, calendar architecture, distribution)
- **Writing actual posts/scripts** → platform hubs (`linkedin/`, `instagram/`, `tiktok/`, `x/`, `youtube/`)
- **SEO execution (keywords, GBP, Google Ads)** → `content/seo`

## Recommended Flow

Skills chain their outputs (each detects prior reports in `output/strategy/`):

1. `brand-identity` → define who you are
   - `brand-book` → package the identity as a shareable PDF once assets exist
2. `content-marketing` → plan the content engine
3. `growth-hacking` → pick traction channels
4. `email-marketing` → build the lifecycle funnel
5. `community-building` → compound retention
